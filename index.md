## Summary

Hey! I am Pavel and I can write code much better than essay that’s why feel free to ask me anything. In my free time I like boarding (skateboard, snowboard, etc.) and travelling by car. I like winter more than summer and spring more than autumn. I have been doing programming since 2006 and love cats ^_^


But to be serious I’m a technical guy with over 10 years of experience in building web applications for desktop and mobile devices. I have a successful track record of translating business requirements into innovative solutions which meet and exceed expectations. Moreover, I specialize in web development and Domain-Driven Design with the most experience in Microsoft technologies. I’m passionate about software design, architecture and design patterns.

I'm good in:

* Complex distributed systems development
* Microservices
* .NET
* CD/CI
* Architectural design
* Code review and refactoring
* Performance and memory profiling and optimizations
* Automated tests

That’s what I like to do in my free time:

* Evening coding for pet-projects
* Snowboarding
* Skateboarding
* Photo (follow me: [@pavelzaitsau](https://www.instagram.com/pavelzaitsau))
